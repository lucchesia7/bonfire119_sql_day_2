# Part 1: Entity Relationship Diagrams 

Using lucidchart, create an ERD for a movie theater (customers, tickets, concessions, movies at minimum but you can have more). Inside of your ERD please backup the reasoning behind why you decided to use the relationships you chose. You can do so by adding text to the bottom of the ERD.

Once your ERD is created, create a new database in pgAdmin 4 and create the tables using the queries we learned today. You must then insert at least 2 rows of data into each table that you create.

NOTE: For an added challenge, feel free to also play around with changing/altering the database tables.

# Part 2: Joins and Merges
Using joins, merges, and subqueries; answer the following questions in pgAdmin4, then save the queries to a SQL file.

1. List all customers who live in Texas (use Joins):
2. Get all payments above $6.99 with the customer's full name
3. Show all customer names that made payments over $175 (use a subquery)
4. List all customers that live in Nepal (use the city table)
5. Which staff member had the most transactions?
6. What film had the most actors in it?
7. Show all customers who have made a single payment above $6.99 (use subqueries)
8. Which category is most prevalent in the films?


In total for this homework assignment, you should have 4 files inside of your GitHub repo:
- ERD as a PDF
- SQL file for creating tables
- SQL file for inserting data into tables (can be combined with above sql file if clearly labeled)
- SQL file for joins and merges

Once done, commit files to GitHub and submit the link to the assignment
